# CHANGELOG

## v1.3.6

* Put storage path inside WordPress content path

## v1.3.5

* Bug fix: calling function that doesn't exist: Plugin::config(), should be Plugin::$config->get()

## v1.3.4

* Under some circumstances, plugins are activated before global $wp_rewrite has been initialized; in these instances, calling flush_rewrite_rules() results in a fatal error; stop doing that

## v1.3.3

* Trap theme-dir errors in test runner

## v1.3.2

* Add package illuminate/mail
* Add proper JSON-encoded output to our custom Exception Handler
* Add support for Exception Handling registration to base Plugin
* Remove old pattern of loading Validator translation from plugin project, favoring instead loading the default from the validation package
* Rough-in pattern for customizable Comment Types
* New Shortcode baseclass: for creating and registering object-oriented shortcodes
* New FieldGroup baseclass: for creating and registering object-oriented ACF field groups (need to spec fluent builder API)
* Add support for custom rewrite rules to Post class
* Add API to base User model for creating and validating stored, expiring private links
* Fix bug in Router::api and Router::resourceâ€”wasn't returning RouteGroup

## v1.3.1

* Remove incomplete test case

## v1.3.0

* Fixed a number of previously undiscovered issues with the use of global function helpers inside of core Providers
* Flushed some more dead code from early prototypes
* Added Scout dependency and setup provider and aliases to be available to all Plugins
* Renamed `CustomTaxonomy` to `Taxonomy`
* Refactored `CustomPostType` into `Post` class, reducing complexity
* Created `CustomSchema` interface to unify registration of Taxonomy and PostType subclasses
* Modified `Plugin::register` to accept both `ServiceProvider` classes as well as `CustomSchema` implementers
* Added support for running Commands through Artisan Console via WP-CLI
* Now using `plugin_basename($this->mainFile)` to generate default router namespace
* Global `plugin($name)` function can be used to load any bootstrapped instance of a Bamboo Plugin
* Setup unit testing and Travis-CI to guarantee future build stability
* Added `FatPanda\Illuminate\WordPress\TestCase` class to ease some plugin unit testing tasks, e.g., REST API endpoint testing
* Setup default Exception Handler: `FatPanda\Illuminate\Support\Exceptions\Handler`; still needs some work, e.g., detecting type of request and reporting the error accordingly
* For clarity, renamed `Plugin::setRouterNamespace` and `Plugin::setRouterVersion` to `Plugin::setRestNamespace` and `Plugin::setRestVersion`, respectively

## v1.2.2

* Fixed another angry namespacing issue
* I had been placing `$plugin` in a global namespace; didn't think that through, and fixed it

## v1.2.1

* Decided not to be such a dick about the namespaces

## v1.2.0

* Changed the way Plugin subclasses are bootstrapped
* Fix a bug in router version number detection and assignment

## v1.1.1

* Add session support to the Plugin baseclass, including a SessionHandler that stores session data in WordPress transients

## v1.1.0

* Not promoted

## v1.0.6

* Fixed bugs in CustomPostType
* Introduced CustomTaxonomy
* Established naming convention for Plugin hooks: on{ActionName} for actions, and filter{FilterName} for filters, with support for @priority codedoc
* Deprecated Bridge::enableEloquent in favor of Bridge::bootEloquent (matches Laravel method name for the same)
* Refactored the way database connections are created, hopefully ensuring that there are never more than two opened for one WordPress request

## v1.0.5

## v1.0.4

## v1.0.3
